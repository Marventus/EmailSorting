Current state of this project: ALPHA.

PROBLEM DEFINITION
====================

One of the biggest enterpise company issues with regards to employee efficiency and time waste is - believe it or not - email. The average fortune 500 employee reads over 10k emails per year that he does not need to read. Multiplied over the expanse of an entire corporation the combined waste of time is staggering.

Many email programs allow manual filering and some attempt automated filtering and sorting. None terribly successfully though. This body of work presented in these pseudo code analyses are an attempt at building a new group of natural language and human behaviour based management of large volumes of email.

====================
WHAT THIS IS
====================

This document is part of a larger body of work being done to improve the state of fuzzy logic algorithms that have to do with sorting and prioritizing email. This is a pseudocode analysis that will be later published in several different codebases to be included into email programs and any other natural language processing software that requires a prioritising and sorting engine for human to human communication.

The steps in this research project are as follows:

[Step 1]: Create algorithms for behavior based sorting. State: ALPHA.
[Step 2]: Create algorithms for natural language based sorting. State: ALPHA.
[Step 3]: Create fuzzy logic analyses for software self learning on variations of a persons long term email behaviour. State: NOT YET BEGUN.
[Step 4]: Create cloud repository API for storing anonymous behaviour patterns for sharing across multiple platforms and software suites. State: NOT YET BEGUN.

====================
HOW TO USE
====================
If you are applying this thinking in any experimental email sorting that you are doing, run the logic in the file in the numbered order starting with the algorithms in the file prefixed 1. then 2. and so on. If you do not use the logic in its entirety it will not be meaningful.
